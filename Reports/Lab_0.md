### Introduction
In this lab, I implemented two of the SOLID principles in a Python project: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open/Closed Principle (OCP). These principles are applied to make code more maintainable, extendable, and easier to manage.

The purpose of the project was to create a simple employee bonus calculation system that adheres to these two SOLID principles.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this lab were:

1. To apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), ensuring that each class has a single responsibility.
2. To implement the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), making the code open for extension but closed for modification.

## Implementation description

### Step 1. Initial Setup

I started by defining an `Employee` class in `employee.py` that handles both storing employee details and calculating the bonus. However, this violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) since the class handles both responsibilities. The initial version of the code is shown below:

```python
# employee.py

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name: str, position: str, salary: float):
        self.name = name
        self.position = position
        self.salary = salary

    def calculate_bonus(self):
        return self.salary * 0.1

```

### Step 2. Applying SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
To follow SRP, I moved the bonus calculation logic into a separate class, BonusCalculator, which is now responsible for calculating bonuses. The Employee class is now only responsible for holding employee data.

Refactor for SRP:

- Created BonusCalculator in `bonus_calculator.py.`
- Updated `Employee` class to delegate bonus calculation to `BonusCalculator`.

```python
# bonus_calculator.py

class BonusCalculator:
    def calculate_bonus(self, salary: float):
        return salary * 0.1

```

```python
# employee.py

from bonus_calculator import BonusCalculator

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name: str, position: str, salary: float):
        self.name = name
        self.position = position
        self.salary = salary
        self.bonus_calculator = BonusCalculator()

    def get_bonus(self):
        return self.bonus_calculator.calculate_bonus(self.salary)

```

### Step 3. Applying OCP (Open/Closed Principle)

To comply with the Open/Closed Principle, I extended the `BonusCalculator` to support multiple types of bonus calculations without modifying the existing code. I introduced two new classes: `StandardBonusCalculator` and `PerformanceBonusCalculator`.

Refactor for OCP:

- The system now supports multiple bonus types without modifying the core `Employee` class.

```python
# bonus_calculator.py

class BonusCalculator:
    def calculate_bonus(self, salary: float):
        raise NotImplementedError("This method should be overridden")

class StandardBonusCalculator(BonusCalculator):
    def calculate_bonus(self, salary: float):
        return salary * 0.1

class PerformanceBonusCalculator(BonusCalculator):
    def calculate_bonus(self, salary: float, performance_score: float):
        return salary * 0.1 + salary * 0.05 * performance_score

```

- In the `Employee` class, I now use different calculators for different types of bonuses:

```python
# employee.py

from bonus_calculator import StandardBonusCalculator, PerformanceBonusCalculator

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name: str, position: str, salary: float, performance_score: float = 0):
        self.name = name
        self.position = position
        self.salary = salary
        self.performance_score = performance_score

    def get_standard_bonus(self):
        bonus_calculator = StandardBonusCalculator()
        return bonus_calculator.calculate_bonus(self.salary)

    def get_performance_bonus(self):
        bonus_calculator = PerformanceBonusCalculator()
        return bonus_calculator.calculate_bonus(self.salary, self.performance_score)

```
### Step 4. Testing

I created a `main.py` file to test the functionality of the system, checking both the standard and performance-based bonus calculations.

```python
# main.py

from employee import Employee

if __name__ == "__main__":
    employee1 = Employee("John Doe", "Developer", 5000)
    print(f"Standard Bonus: {employee1.get_standard_bonus()}")

    employee2 = Employee("Jane Smith", "Manager", 8000, performance_score=4)
    print(f"Performance Bonus: {employee2.get_performance_bonus()}")

```
**Output**

```
Standard Bonus: 500.0
Performance Bonus: 1600.0
```

--- 
## Results

After implementing SRP and OCP, the system behaves as expected:

- The Single Responsibility Principle was applied by refactoring the bonus calculation into a separate class.
- The Open/Closed Principle was applied by introducing extensible bonus types without modifying the core functionality.

- Key Results:

- For a developer with a salary of $5000, the standard bonus is calculated as `$500.0`.
- For a manager with a salary of $8000 and a performance score of 4, the performance bonus is calculated as `$1600.0`.

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrates the practical application of two important SOLID principles: Single Responsibility Principle and Open/Closed Principle. By adhering to these principles, I ensured that the system remains easy to maintain, extend, and modify in the future without breaking existing functionality.

This approach can be extended further by adding new types of bonus calculators as needed, without impacting the core employee functionality.
